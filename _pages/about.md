I was born in Dezhou, a small city in Shandong Province, China. 
I studied painting for 9 years with great passion during my childhood. Unfortunately, I had to give it up due the amazing result in the high school entrance examination. I finished my high school at the age of 18 and managed to Wuhan University, feeling I was a little interested in mathematics and mathematics. Then I got postgraduate recommendation and went to Beijing(Peking) as a graduate student at University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Thanks for your attention! I'm eager to meet more friends of the same will!
